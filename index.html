            <h4>Whiskers’ Second Chance</h4>
            <span>Whiskers, a shy tabby cat, had spent nearly a year in the shelter. That changed when Mia, a college student battling loneliness in a new city, saw Whiskers' profile. What started as a hesitant connection soon became inseparable companionship. Now, Mia says, “Whiskers didn’t just find a home—she gave me one too.”</span>

            <h2>Max & Martin – A New Beginning</h2>
            <span>After losing his senior dog, Martin wasn’t sure he was ready to open his heart again. But then he met Max—a gentle soul with sad eyes and a quiet, loyal presence. The connection was instant. Within days, Max had become Martin’s steadfast companion, joining him on hikes, curling up beside him during late-night movies, and even helping him reconnect with neighbors during their daily walks. “I thought I was rescuing Max,” Martin says, “but really, he rescued me.”</span>

            <h2>Milo’s Golden Retirement</h2>
            <span>Milo, a 10-year-old orange cat and former therapy cat, was adopted by Nora, a widowed senior looking for a calm, affectionate companion. The bond was immediate. Now, Milo curls up beside Nora during her morning tea, follows her from room to room, and sits quietly by her side at book club gatherings. “I thought I was giving Milo a peaceful home,” Nora says, “but he gave me comfort I didn’t know I needed.”</span>
