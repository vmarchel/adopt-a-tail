                        <span>Whiskers, a shy tabby cat, had been waiting in the shelter for almost a year. That changed when 12-year-old Lily walked in with her parents, looking for a furry friend. At first, Whiskers was a little nervous, but Lily sat quietly by her side, reading stories and offering treats. Day by day, their bond grew. Now, they do everything together—homework, movie nights, even tea parties. “Whiskers is my best friend,” Lily says. “She makes every day better.”</span>
